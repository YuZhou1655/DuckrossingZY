        <p>Duckrossing is a final project of CIM504 Designing Playful Experience, instructed by Professor <a
            href="https://professorgrace.com/"> Lindsay Grace</a>, designed and developed by Yu Zhou, Lejie Lin and
          Shangshu Shi in four weeks span.</p>

        <h2 class="subsubheader"></h2>

        <p>People say "walk a mile in someone's shoes" so that you can truly understand the other`s situations, and
          Duckrossing is such a game. It provides a 10 minutes playful experience with alternative controller which let
          player walks in duck feet, control in-game movement by physically moving their legs, and use two arms to
          control wings for flying. Player will take on an adventure of a new born duck who cross from noon to midnight,
          city to wild, and from a baby to a parent.</p>
        <p>This Alternative Controls not only challenges player`s physical skills but also fosters a deeper connection
          between their physical actions and in-game avatar movements and offers a higher level of engagement that
          cannot be replicated through standard controllers such as keyboards, mouse, and controllers. </p>

      <p class="imgNote">Designer: Yu Zhou Developer: Yu Zhou</p>
      <img class="imgM" alt="designing 3D Model" src="LevelIntro.png">
      <p>This is the intro level of Duckrossing where players are placed inside the egg trying to break the shell by moving arms and legs.        </p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    


      <h1 class="subsubheader">Level 1:Duck Corss Road</h1>
      <p class="imgNote">Designer:Lejie Lin, Yu Zhou Developer: Lejie Lin, Yu Zhou</p>
      <img class="imgM" alt="designing 3D Model" src="Level1.png">
      <p>Level 1 introduces a dynamic scenario on a two-way, undertaking the challenge of traversing the thoroughfare
        with caution. Negotiating the journey entails encountering diverse vehicles with varying speeds. The stakes are
        high, as any collision with a vehicle results in immediate failure. Furthermore, players must be attuned to
        maintaining a specific walking rhythm, avoiding the pitfall of stretching their legs too far apart,.
        Interestingly, even successful crossings don't guarantee success, as players risk being penalized for
        jaywalking. The unconventional resolution to this level is abstaining from crossing altogether; after a
        30-second interval, players seamlessly progress to the next stage, aligning with the game creator's intent to
        discourage risky behavior.</p>


      <h1 class="subsubheader">Level 2:Duck Cross Tracks</h1>
      <p class="imgNote">Designer:Lejie Lin Developer: Lejie Lin</p>
      <img class="imgM" alt="designing 3D Model" src="Level2.png">
      <p>In the second level, players are tasked with adhering to traffic signals, ensuring a safe crossing only when
        the red light halts the flow of traffic. Upon reaching the opposite side, a railroad crossing introduces an
        additional challenge—players must patiently wait for a passing train before continuing safely. A noteworthy
        development occurs at the conclusion of this level: the little duck undergoes a growth spurt, transforming into
        grown up duck and thereby preparing itself for the impending challenges that lie ahead</p>

      <p>In the third level, player now as a grown up duck, is finally able to fly with their wings. Their wing-flapping
        skill will be tested with a mudpit at the middle of road. It is a basic flying ability check, and revealing the
        movement and limitations of flying to players. </p>

      <img class="imgM" alt="designing 3D Model" src="Level4.png">
      <p>The fourth level combines all the challenges players have faced. Bats emerge from a dark , requiring players to
        either keep moving forward or fly high to dodge them. A swift wolf adds another layer of danger, demanding quick
        reactions to take off. And there is a health system balancing the constant threat of bats with the occasional
        lethal challenge of the dog: deducts one heart for bat attacks and all hearts for dog encounters.</p>

    <div class="subcontent">
      <img class="imgL" alt="designing 3D Model" src="SoundDesign1.png">
      <p> The sound design of the duck crossing comes in a multi-dimensional idea. It both attempts to recreate the
        experience of playing as a duck, as realistic as possible, and has the desire of fitting everything into that
        kind of “cartoonish” and “fun-experience” while everything still fits itself into a serious pondering question
        of animal cruelty that this world is constantly facing.</p>

      <p> The general workflow of the sound design is two-folded. For most of the workflow, I have to wait for the
        general game system to be finished so that I can go ahead and insert my sound into the game system, while
        incorporating the game system with the dynamic sound system that I designed. This can be seen at a lot of
        places, such as the way how a round-robin system would be applied to the footstep and wing-flapping system so
        that players feel more immersed into the game, but also one of the fun part where the player will hear the
        intensity of the frostbite to the duck when player’s frost condition is getting worse. The developing ideology
        of the idea is that we want the sound to be integrated, instead of being “attatched” to the system and can
        interactively provide players an “UI-like” experience. 
      </p>
      <img class="imgR" alt="designing 3D Model" src="SoundDesign2.png">
      <p> Of course, lots of things have been carefully planned out and went through numerous iterations to reach the
        final result. For example, we extracted multiple kinds of sounds of the duck- From the typical American duck to
        African duck to get the best desired sound that both fits into the cartoonish vibe that the game provides, but
        also makes it more realistic compared to the typical “donald the duck” kinds of absurdity. In the end, around
        80-90 sound file were put into the game so that we can cover the variety of worlds that the duck crosses
        throughout the game. From the most modern city to the wildest part of the woods and lake, we attempted to make
        sure that players feel like they are actually experiencing the situation that the duck is trying to cross.

      Given my role as the sole team member with art experience, particularly in Adobe Illustrator, I took on the
      responsibility of creating all art assets for the game. Considering time constraints, overall workload, and my
      skill level, I opted for a relatively simple style, using basic graphics and a limited color palette to convey
      scenes like time changes, night atmospheres, and the four seasons and in-game NPCs, such as bats and crocodiles.
      However, during the creation of the top view of the vehicle, my stick figure version was eventually replaced with
      artwork generated by the Illustrator's own AI after a team discussion.
